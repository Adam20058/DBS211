- Notes I took for my DBS211 Class and SQL bootcamp I was following. Repo also includes small projects.

It is mostly focused on key fundamentals SQL and the different DBMS.

## Why does it matter?

How do you eat an elephant... One bite at a time

I believe by completing and solving these several micro projects (each of which highlight key fundamental areas in programming) the closer you would get to using your computer to create cool projects that you're probably wishing you could make right now (I know I am).

But in the meantime you'll need to understand Databases and how to access + augment your computational thinking abilities.

## The Rundown

This collection of micro projects highlight the following fundamentals in web development (not in any order):

- Creating Databases and Tables
- Inserting Data (and a couple other things)
- CRUD commands
- The World of String Functions
- Refining Our Selections
- Aggregate Functions
- Data Types
- Logical Operators
- One to Many
- Many to Many
- Introduction to Node
- Application Development
- Database Triggers
- Security Transaction
- Database Design
- Normalization

## Final Notes

Since I found creating and breaking down things to be the quickest way to learn. Feel free to use my notes to learn more about concepts covered in this class. But please don't use any of my material for submitting class assignments!!!

Goodluck and Enjoy!!!
